class Manager:
    """
    ``Manager`` for reading, writing and storing options for ASDF blocks.

    This class does the heavy lifting of allowing ``asdf.AsdfFile`` instances
    to control ASDF blocks. It is responsible for reading and writing blocks
    primarily to maintain some consistency with the previous BlockManager.

    Block ``Options`` control the compression and type of storage for an
    ASDF block (see `asdf.AsdfFile.set_array_storage`,
    `asdf.AsdfFile.set_array_compression`
    `asdf.AsdfFile.set_array_compression` for relevant usage and information).
    These ``Options`` instances are stored and retrieved using the base
    of the array containing the data for an ASDF block. This allows arrays
    that share the same base array (ie views of the same array) to use
    the same ASDF block.

    Reading blocks occurs through use of ``Manager.read`` which will
    create ``ReadBlock`` instances for each read ASDF block. These ``ReadBlock``
    will be used as the source for default ``Options`` for each block
    and ASDF block data can be read using ``DataCallback`` instances.
    These callbacks are used (instead of just accessing blocks by index)
    to allow block reorganization during ``update``.(Note that reading
    of external blocks is special as these are not stored within the
    block section of the ASDF file. These must be explicitly loaded
    using ``Manager._load_external``).

    Writing ASDF blocks occurs through use of ``Manager.write`` which will
    take any queued ``WriteBlocks`` (created via ``Manager.make_write_block``
    and ``Manager.set_streamed_write_block``) and write them out to a file.
    This writing must occur within a ``Manager.write_context`` to allow the
    ``Manager`` to reset any ``Options`` changes that occur during write
    and to clean up the write queue.

    Update-in-place occurs through use of ``Manager.update`` which, like
    ``Manager.write`` must occur within a ``Manager.write_context``. Following
    a ``Manager.update`` the ``ReadBlock`` instances will be replaced with
    the newly written ASDF blocks and any ``DataCallbacks`` will be updated
    to reference the appropriate new ``ReadBlock``.
