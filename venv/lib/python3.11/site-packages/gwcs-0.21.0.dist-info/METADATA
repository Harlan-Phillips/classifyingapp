Generalized World Coordinate System (GWCS) is an `Astropy`_ affiliated package providing tools for managing the World Coordinate System of astronomical data.

GWCS takes a general approach to the problem of expressing transformations between pixel and world coordinates. It supports a data model which includes the entire transformation pipeline from input coordinates (detector by default) to world coordinates. It is tightly integrated with `Astropy`_.

- Transforms are instances of ``astropy.Model``. They can be chained, joined or combined with arithmetic operators using the flexible framework of compound models in `astropy.modeling`_.
- Celestial coordinates are instances of ``astropy.SkyCoord`` and are transformed to other standard celestial frames using `astropy.coordinates`_.
- Time coordinates are represented by ``astropy.Time`` and can be further manipulated using the tools in `astropy.time`_
- Spectral coordinates are ``astropy.Quantity`` objects and can be converted to other units using the tools in `astropy.units`_.

For complete features and usage examples see the `documentation`_ site.
